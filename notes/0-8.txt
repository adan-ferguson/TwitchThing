v0.8.1.0
--------
**General**
- Chests no longer contain gold, you'll get gold whenever you kill an enemy instead (like every JRPG ever).
- Increased the amount of XP required to level up for levels beyond 100. This change will lower the levels of some adventurers.
- Skills will automatically equip when unlocked if there's an empty slot for them to go.
- Hidden convenience thing: You can shift+click when spending points to spend 5 at a time.

**Monsters (Regular Versions)**
Numbers-only Changes
- Buffs: Druid, Bitey Plant, Hydra, Siren, Two-Headed Shark, Water Elemental, Cerberus, Night Mare, Pit Fiend, Succubus, Demoted Lucifer
- Nerfs: Werewolf, Centaur, Assassin, Basilisk, Wyvern, Maniacal Minion.

Triablo
- Added a "Triple Attack" ability to help it deal with dodges/bat wings/wizard hats. Phys power reduced to compensate.
- Speed increased.

**Rogue**
Just attempting to neuter the farming a little bit, because the strategy of farming to purchase more farmers ad nauseam seems a bit degenerate. This might just always be overpowered though, or maybe it's fine. Idk.

The Bounty Collector
- No longer gives chests, now increases the gold reward from the enemy by 4x/7/10x/...
- Cost changed from 10/15/20/... to 10/17/24/...

v0.8.0.6 (Aug 30, 2023)
--------
- Fixed bug where skills would revert if you changed them, then went to points tab, then went back to loadout tab. (There still might be some problems though)
- Fixed final combat being really long in the replay
- Trying to fix some socket thing
- (Accidentally included this LOL) you can now upgrade skills from the loadout tab via right-click

v0.8.0.5
--------
- Fixed bug where old events weren't purging.
- Fixed bug where users weren't unlocking the next zone after clearing a zone.
- Fixed bug where results page showed wrong number of xp if the run was really long. (Not a retroactive fix)

v0.8.0.4
--------
- Fixed some more DB problems
- On results page, if you have more than 20 chests, it will just say "...and more" instead of loading all of them and freezing the page.
- There's also a "loot" results tab that has everything added up and sorted.
- When you view a replay, it will only load 100 events instead of like a billion of them.

v0.8.0.3
--------
- Database changes should result in faster loading times when opening dungeon runs.
- Extremely long runs will save much faster and hopefully no longer get stuck and slow down the server.
- Implemented some compression so there's less downloading, plus it will warn if you're downloading all the data for an extremely long run.
- As a consequence, the event log is no longer visible until the run is finished. Maybe it'll be back later.

v0.8.0.2
------
- Fixed bug where penance would crash the run when you rest.
- Fixed firefox bug where skills had their icon way off to the side.
- Other logging stuff, attempting to find the source of the slowness.

v0.8.0.1
------
- Fixed bug where a run would crash if you got 2 chests in 1 fight. (The Bounty Collector + random chest or boss chest)
- Fixed bug where your loadout would revert. (There's still another similar bug with skills that I haven't found yet)
- Fixed bug where status effects weren't extending correctly (haste, coffee carafe).

v0.8.0
------
New Things:
- Users can not play anonymously without logging in, which was a big sticking point for people (understandably).
- Skill selector added, gain one skill point for each 5 levels gained. The previous idea of "random skill options on level-up" has been removed, because it was hard to make it interesting.
- Now have 8 item slots AND 8 skill slots.
- 5 classes, rogue unlocked level 30, ??? unlocked level 40.
- Each class now has 12 items, 12 skills. In general, the old items have been split up into items & skills, usually active abilities are skills.
- 6th zone added, the "super dungeon" has been removed for now.
- You can now buy "Stashed XP", which you can give to adventurers. You also get stashed XP when you dismiss an adventurer (50%).

Changes:
- Basically remade the entire battle engine, a lot of small differences, but you'd have to be looking close to even see them.
- Lots of enemies have a bunch of changes because I had to remake all of them too.
- Speed has more diminishing returns, both positive and negative.
- Some abilities also now have diminishing returns. They'll have a double-down-arrow icon.
- When leveling up items, now they generally also increase in Orb cost. No more level 250 items, unfortunately. (Or I mean, I guess technically you could...)
- Starting food is now 2 + 1 per 10 levels.
- Gold accrual is a lot flatter now.
- Adventurer slot prices don't grow as harshly now. (Free -> 1000 -> 2000 -> 5000 -> 10000 -> ... )
- Shop chests now cap at level 100.
- To prevent overly long combats, after 60 seconds, combats enter "overtime" which increases all damage dealt by more and more the longer it goes. After 120 seconds, the player starts taking unpreventable damage.
- A bunch of other things, who cares.

Improvements:
- In the shop, some items have sliders, so you can buy multiple at once. (Not chests yet, but I don't think you'll be buying like a billion of them anymore anyway)
- Tooltips generally improved in many ways (probably wasted too much time on these, honestly)
- You can now upgrade items from the adventurer loadout page. When you right-click an item, if you have forge unlocked, it'll show an "upgrade" button.
- Combats should generally calculate faster, and slow ones won't crash the server or slow everyone else down. Still a lot of work to do on this though.
- More, probably.

Fixes:
- Fixed a lot, but the funniest bug before was cooldown multiplier affecting status effect ticks. Cooldown reduction now just affects your active items. (Or does it? ...)
