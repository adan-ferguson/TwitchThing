Milestone 3
2022-02-05 - 2022-02-21
----------
- Very basic combat
++ Combat page
++ Generic bat enemy that scales with floor
++ No items, just damage amounts
++ Adventure ends when run out of hp
++ Adventurer's max hp and damage goes up as they level up
++ Advancing floors
++ Combat should have full fighter documents so replays work

+ Clear all data on live

+ Actually DON'T derive stats
++ Store stats obj in adventurers (and fighters later)
++ HP and ATK grow% per level
++ Levelup screen shows hp + damage increase amounts
++ Choose bonuses (hp or atk)
++ Test

+ Remove ventures
++ Reorganize a bunch of stuff
++ Make everything work again

+ Collections objects
++ Reduce usage of projections since they just cause bugs mostly

To Fix:
+ Flying text
+ End of fight is clunky on both sides

+ Bars are buggy, just use non-caked animations
++ State updates if there's no actual updates
++ HP bar should use red thing like fighting game

TODO Later
-----------

- View previous dungeon runs
-- Shareable
-- Dungeon runs will also have to use adventurer doc copies
