2022-01-08

+ Basic XP gain
++ While in dungeon

2022-01-22
----------
+ Milestone 2
++ Multilevel-up fade-out + fade-in
++ Save adv and user xp
++ Fix bar animations
++ Main page doesn't change adventurer when venture finishes in realtime

===============
MILESTONE 3
===============

2022-01-23
----------
+ Show error in name selection form

2022-01-26
----------
+ Better bars
++ getters for values
++ special rankup bar
++ Number ticking
++ gradient for healthbar

+ Adventurer stats object, for use when not in dungeon
+ Adventurer state definition object (stored in each event object)
+ Adventurer state + stats extrapolation

2022-02-02
----------
+ Stats
++ Derive HP
++ Derive attack

Milestone 3
Started 2022-02-05
----------
- Very basic combat
++ Combat page
++ Generic bat enemy that scales with floor
++ No items, just damage amounts
++ Adventure ends when run out of hp
++ Adventurer's max hp and damage goes up as they level up
++ Advancing floors
++ Combat should have full fighter documents so replays work

+ Clear all data on live

+ Actually DON'T derive stats
++ Store stats obj in adventurers (and fighters later)
++ HP and ATK grow% per level
++ Levelup screen shows hp + damage increase amounts
++ Choose bonuses (hp or atk)
++ Test

+ Remove ventures
++ Reorganize a bunch of stuff
++ Make everything work again

+ Collections objects
++ Reduce usage of projections since they just cause bugs mostly

To Fix:
+ Flying text
+ End of fight is clunky on both sides

+ Bars are buggy, just use non-caked animations
++ State updates if there's no actual updates
++ HP bar should use red thing like fighting game


Milestone 4 - Stats
-------------------
Implement some stats in order to allow adventurers and monsters to differentiate each other.
These are required before implementing items because...well, items without stats are just nothing.
-------------------
+ tippy

+ Remove font awesome react
+ Use font awesome regular

+ Scaling math, use Math.pow(<factor>, levels) and Math.log(<factor>, val)

+ Don't send entire event array in socket update
++ test

+ requestAnimationFrame doesn't work when alt-tabbed so be aware of that
++ test

+ Then for the clientside
++ A display string
++ A tooltip

+ Implement the following stats, fairly basic stuff but a variety
++ Armor
+++ Test
+++ Clientside
++ Speed
+++ Test
+++ Clientside
++ Lifesteal
+++ Test
+++ Clientside
++ XP Gain
+++ Test
+++ Clientside
++ Adventuring Speed
+++ Test
+++ Clientside
++ Stair find chance
+++ Test
+++ Clientside
++ Relic find chance
+++ Test
+++ Clientside

+ When you level up it should pull more options

+ Make some monsters that are sort of a variety of these things
++ Basic generator logic w/ minimum floors
++ Skeleton
++ Bat
++ Golem
++ Vampire
++ Dragon

+ Make combats last a big longer by buffing HP

+ Levelups
++ Have offensive/defensive/adventuring option groups
++ Clientside

+ Stats should have the following things
++ A stat type (flat, percentage, etc)
++ Some sort of weight value for determining levelups (eg. 500 hp and 500 armor are not the same weight)
++ Tags (defensive, offensive, magic, etc)
++ test

+ Relics:
++ Small XP gain
++ Large XP gain
++ HP restore
++ test
++ HP restore doesn't seem to happen + doesn't show clientside

+ User levelups should unlock new adventurer slots every 10 levels

+ Clear all adventurers

+ Results page:
++ what floor/room
++ Show level up! Message if adventurer/user levels up
++ Show "you unlocked a new adventurer slot" if user levels up

+ Add login providers for twitch & google
++ set them up on live

4.5
---------
- Don't animate hp bar after combat

- Results page
-- Show what you died to
-- Show # of monsters killed, relics found

- Choose floor
- Keep track of adv max floor

- Admin page
-- Clear all adventurers

- Have XP gain do the number tickup thing (dungeon run page)

+ Prevent combat infinite loop
++ Handle combat result without set winner server side
-- ...and client side

- Fix the styling of the logout dropdown +
- Fix janky thing when first start dungeon run
- Tooltips get stuck if they're showing when you get a dungeon run update
- Heal animation looks wrong especially when near a damage animation

=============
Milestone 5
=============
Loadout + Items for both adventurers and monsters.
Adventurer levels up now depend on their held items.
Item and Monsters should now use the generator.
Test some monster mods for the monster loadouts. No base stats other than hp/attack.

TODO Later
-----------
- On main page show when adventurer is in combat

- Fix flex styling/loadouts

- Bonuses are +1, +2 -1, +3 -1 -1
- StatList + buff + debuff display

- Mobile considerations
-- Tooltips

- Move monsters to generator
- Big numbers will be a problem
- Janky going back from combat to adv
-- Timer at combat resets funny
-- Generally the visuals seem to jump

- Big numbers will be a problem
- Back button browser acts like back button header?
- Stupid webpack openssl thing, upgrade webpack or whatever
- npm audit

- Admin page bonus logs

- Fix errors + targetPage redirects

- View previous dungeon runs
-- Shareable
-- Dungeon runs will also have to use adventurer doc copies
-- Event log viewer
-- Combat timeline

- Make a 404 page and/or just redirect
- DB backups
- Modal nice fadein effect
