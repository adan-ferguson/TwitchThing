New Things:
- Added new Rogue class, which unlocks once you reach floor 30.
- Rarity of items no longer tied to its orb count, which gives me added flexibility to work with. For example, Rogue has a rare item with 0 orb cost.
- Added a "leave" button. Your adventurer will attempt to leave if you toggle this on, though it's sort of delayed because what you see is a few seconds behind what's actually happening.

Adjustments:


Fixes:
- Results no longer says "Killed by: Something" if nothing killed you.
- Fixed some animation problems, such as when changing between events.
- Added some infinite loop protection. Combats will just crash/abort the run if a tick triggers too many events or if time stops advancing.
