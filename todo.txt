Milestone 3
Started 2022-02-05
----------
- Very basic combat
++ Combat page
++ Generic bat enemy that scales with floor
++ No items, just damage amounts
++ Adventure ends when run out of hp
++ Adventurer's max hp and damage goes up as they level up
++ Advancing floors
++ Combat should have full fighter documents so replays work

+ Clear all data on live

+ Actually DON'T derive stats
++ Store stats obj in adventurers (and fighters later)
++ HP and ATK grow% per level
++ Levelup screen shows hp + damage increase amounts
++ Choose bonuses (hp or atk)
++ Test

+ Remove ventures
++ Reorganize a bunch of stuff
++ Make everything work again

+ Collections objects
++ Reduce usage of projections since they just cause bugs mostly

To Fix:
+ Flying text
+ End of fight is clunky on both sides

+ Bars are buggy, just use non-caked animations
++ State updates if there's no actual updates
++ HP bar should use red thing like fighting game


Milestone 4 - Stats
-------------------
Implement some stats in order to allow adventurers and monsters to differentiate each other.
These are required before implementing items because...well, items without stats are just nothing.
-------------------
+ tippy

+ Remove font awesome react
+ Use font awesome regular

+ Scaling math, use Math.pow(<factor>, levels) and Math.log(<factor>, val)

+ Don't send entire event array in socket update
++ test

+ requestAnimationFrame doesn't work when alt-tabbed so be aware of that
++ test

+ Then for the clientside
++ A display string
++ A tooltip

+ Implement the following stats, fairly basic stuff but a variety
++ Armor
+++ Test
+++ Clientside
++ Speed
+++ Test
+++ Clientside
++ Lifesteal
+++ Test
+++ Clientside
++ XP Gain
+++ Test
+++ Clientside
++ Adventuring Speed
+++ Test
+++ Clientside
++ Stair find chance
+++ Test
+++ Clientside
++ Relic find chance
+++ Test
+++ Clientside

+ When you level up it should pull more options

+ Make some monsters that are sort of a variety of these things
++ Basic generator logic w/ minimum floors
++ Skeleton
++ Bat
++ Golem
++ Vampire
++ Dragon

+ Make combats last a big longer by buffing HP

+ Levelups
++ Have offensive/defensive/adventuring option groups
++ Clientside

+ Stats should have the following things
++ A stat type (flat, percentage, etc)
++ Some sort of weight value for determining levelups (eg. 500 hp and 500 armor are not the same weight)
++ Tags (defensive, offensive, magic, etc)
++ test

+ Relics:
++ Small XP gain
++ Large XP gain
++ HP restore
++ test
++ HP restore doesn't seem to happen + doesn't show clientside

+ User levelups should unlock new adventurer slots every 10 levels

+ Clear all adventurers

+ Results page:
++ what floor/room
++ Show level up! Message if adventurer/user levels up
++ Show "you unlocked a new adventurer slot" if user levels up

+ Add login providers for twitch & google
++ set them up on live

4.5
---------

=============
Milestone 5 - 2022-03-xx
=============
Loadout + Items for both adventurers and monsters.
Adventurer levels up now depend on their held items.
Item and Monsters should now use the generator.
Test some monster mods for the monster loadouts. No base stats other than hp/attack.

+ Loadout Editor
++ Draggable and whatnot
++ Saving
++ Back page needs a "confirm" dialog if changes are being lost
++ Store inventory values as an object instead

+ Support for stat percentage format
+ Stat rows don't get remove if the stat gets removed

+ Admin page
++ Run a command

+ Move monsters to generator

+ Start at level 0
+ Speed as a percentage is obtuse, show the action time?
+ Fix rounding error, 1.2 adventuring speed displays as 19%
+ Don't store base item stats in the DB, so if we change base item definition then it changes the item

+ User levelup rewards show a popup
++ multiples of 10 new slot
++ level 1 sword
++ other levels random item

+ After level 1, the "edit equipment" button should appear with a "NEW" effect

+ Item drops
++ They don't drop unless user level >= 1
++ Monsters can drop
++ Chest relic

+ Tests for composite stats because they display incorrectly with attack +10%
+ "Combat Turn Time" is backwards description, it should say "Combat Speed" if additive

+ Illegal loadout possible to save
+ Orbs don't update on loadouts

+ Quick animation between chest openages
++ Level-up chests not showing up anymore
++ Rewards didn't apply correctly (not applying either level or regular)

+ no relics until level 1 either
+ results screen: show green/red on stats list for bonus stats
+ Speed stats have shouldn't show their cumulative name when being additive, 'combat speed' +10%, 'combat turn time' 2.7s
+ Results stats lists text align left

+ Dungeon page doesn't show items
+ Show collected chests on dungeon page
+ Show message when monster drops chest
+ Pagination doesn't display correct numbers
+ The first event message doesn't show

+ Make some simple items
+ Make some simple monsters
++  1 to 10 (cave)
++ 11 to 20 (undead)

+ zones
++ Floors now only get larger per zone, also multiples of 10 are double sized
++ Skew slightly towards the higher number monster rank
++ Monsters only appear in their own zone
++ Keep track of adventurer maximum floor
++ Choose zone
++ Fix styling on dungeon choose page

+ Level ups, not in modal anymore
+ Make adventurer pages + page validation more sane

+ Instead of dungeonRun and results page states, just have the 1.
++ Adventurer is either in a dungeon or is idle.
++ You're considered in a dungeon if you haven't confirmed results.

+ adventurer rows
++ let me open in new tab
++ show dungeon run data (hp, floor, room, fighting)

+ Make sure pages can't redirect if they've been unloaded

+ Just show all the char levelups dont pause between, pause at end though

+ Main page actually show the error

+ header
++ Add page title
++ Narrow the header

+ Transition from dungeon end to results not working

+ Combat page jank
++ Don't have a combat page, instead have it on the dungeonRun page
++ Timer before combat goes down a bit
++ Timer after combat does not start
++ Shrink the combat footer size
++ Don't show irrelevant stats inside of combat/outside of combat
++ Timer before combat gets reduced by ~5000 for some reason
++ Prevent combat from being stuck if tabbed out

+ exploring time meter (start time -> virtual time -> elapsed time)
+ mousewheel on lists
+ Prevent immediate event on dungeon start
+ adventurer row timers need timeSinceLastEvent added
+ Show blocked damage

+ Exploring subpage not animating relics, xp gain

+ Public dungeon page
+ Public pages need to subscribe to socket events correctly
+ Clear hash query value after going back to main

+ No stairs on floor 20

+ Add a few more items
++ Level 2 weapon (machete)
++ Level 3 weapon (+attack -def)
++ Level 6 weapon (+attack -xp gain)
++ A level 10 item

+ get rid of variant adventuring speed
+ multiplicative relic find, stair find, xp gain
+ XP: 0 sometimes

+ Right click item for more info in modal
+ Improve information on item tooltip
++ Should say "right-click for more info"
++ Fix some bugs with item tooltips sticking
++ Don't make x scrollbar appear

+ toDisplayName wherever we use monster/items names: 'monsterName' => 'Monster Name'
+ Loadout edit page: show "new" effect for new items first time you enter
+ ChestOpenage UI is still a bit weird, not obvious it's new loot? Make it say "new items" at least

+ Sometimes bugged going to results page (when tabbed out?)

+ +hpMax items don't start you at full hp
+ nextroom/nextfloor should affect NEXT event not this one
+ load fails sometimes

+ Loadout editor, add an element in-between that's like
++ "--> move item here LOL"

+ intertwining of dungeonruns
+ no instant-stairs
+ loadoout editor tooltips not working on 1st slot of loadout
+ things still get stuck a lot while tabbed out

+ Test on firefox

+ Put git pull in full build
+ npm audit


5.5
-----------
+ Buff items
+ Limit lvl 20 time
+ Show everyone's adventurers in admin page, can view their pane or their active dungeonrun
+ gitignore not ignoring combined files

*****************************************
    Milestone 6
    - Classes
    - 3rd zone
    - Enemy items
*****************************************

New Features:
- Replay combat
- Combat permalinks
- Adventure log (viewable on results page or inside of exploring page)
- View old adventures/combats
+ HP + Power as all base values
+ Classes

+ New stats
++ Dodge chance
++ Crit factor
++ Relic quality
++ Chest find
++ Regeneration

Component Changes:

+ OrbsData w/ classes

+ More icons in general
- Don't use hash queries for adventurer new tab
+ Go back to adventurer page not having subpages, page.load() contains source info
+ Detach user levelups from dungeon results page

+ Socket reconnection should rejoin rooms, maybe even reload the current page?
-- Reload current page

+ Show name of zone while exploring
++ Show a theme for each multiple of 10 floors (background texture)

+ StatDisplayInfo for additionals if they're percentages (removal of composites should help this)

- Admin page
-- Show ajax errors which were thrown
-- Show console logs
-- List combats
-- Simulate a combat

Game Systems/Balance:
+ Remove "pending" events, replace with "stayInRoom" events
++ Change combat

+ Remove user xp
-- New slot when you unlock a new zone

+ Instead of dipping difficulty at start of a new zone, make it spike
+ Make monster chance a flat pct (with buffer between fights), 30%? increase per zone?
+ get rid of composite percentages -> flat or multipliers
+ get rid of variant adventuring speed from the dungeonrunner

+ DungeonRun stores adventurer doc in it so old ones can be viewed
++ This doc also needs hpMax + power in case their formulas get changed
++ Combat also needs the same treatment

+ Monsters just use a default calculated HP and Power (which gets scaled up)
++ Their first slot in loadout will describe their specializations

- Monster mods
-- Make 3rd zone of monsters

+ Class bonuses
+ Class items

- Magic damage
-- Test

Bugs/UI Tweaks:
+ Make the glow effect much more obvious
- Get a new font

- AdventurerRow
-- Enemy displayname
-- Red for combat

- Show time on results page

- Have loadout rows contain an inner element
-- So it's easier to click/hover them
-- So the inner part can be used on item details page

- Make combat page redder in general

+ Fix fake double stairs

- Dragged items have z-index on top

+ Loadout shouldn't show orbs if they're 0

- Final event is wack

- No back-to-back relics
- Relics found count is wrong
- Healing relic not healing?
- Graphic for various events
- Show a popup for first time you see dungeon picker
- Show chest contents
- no icon stat list tooltip

TODO Later
-----------
- Active items
- Consolidate adventurerInstance and fighterInstance
- More interesting relic UI
- Gold
- Use more classes for things because like
- Resting
- Gussy up the tabz to make easier to use, di-tab-content
- di-adventurer-list
- Socket disconnect/reconnect rejoin room
- Random crashes?

- Combat load fails sometimes
- Sometimes fake results page?

- Dungeon page chests display
-- Animate the addition of chests
-- Have chest icons for tiers

- fighter toDisplayName probably bugged

- View combat replays

- StatList + buff + debuff display

- Mobile considerations
-- Tooltips

- Big numbers will be a problem

- Fix errors + targetPage redirects

- View previous dungeon runs
-- Shareable
-- Dungeon runs will also have to use adventurer doc copies
-- Event log viewer
-- Combat timeline

- Make a 404 page and/or just redirect
- DB backups
- Modal nice fadein effect

- More detailed results
-- Monsters killed list
-- Relics found list

- Next time ssl cert expires, get the auto-renewing working

- Do some lazy loading later?

- Specialized dungeons
-- The goal is to incentivize different builds
